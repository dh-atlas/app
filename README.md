The goal of the ATLAS is to create a knowledge graph of the international scholarly research on Italian Cultural Heritage leveraged in a Web portal that fosters usersâ€™ interpretation and engagement.
The catalogue is published via [CLEF](https://polifonia-project.github.io/clef/) (*Crowdsourcing Linked Entities via web Form*), a lightweight Linked Open Data native cataloguing system tailored to small-medium crowdsourcing projects.

    <h3>A knowledge graph of the international scholarly research on Italian Cultural Heritage</h3>
    <p>The goal of the ATLAS is to create a knowledge graph of the international scholarly research on Italian Cultural Heritage leveraged in
      a Web portal that fosters usersâ€™ interpretation and engagement.</p>
    <p>The Atlas aims to collect, enrich, and provide information extracted
      from online resources produced in the international academic context, such as digital textual corpora and editions as well as datasets 
      following Linked Open Data principles and databases, but also ontologies and tools
      adopted in the community.</p>
